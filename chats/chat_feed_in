Excellent questions! Let me address each one practically, especially given your constraints and boss's priorities.
1. Multivariate Mixture Distributions

Yes, you can create mixtures of multivariate normals! Here's how:
python

# Each of 100 prompts gives you:
# μ_k = [μ_oil, μ_exchange, μ_competitor] (mean vector)
# Σ_k = covariance matrix (3x3 for 3 variables)

# Final mixture:
p(β) = Σ(k=1 to 100) π_k * MultivariateNormal(μ_k, Σ_k)

# In code:
class MultivariateMixture:
    def __init__(self, means, covariances, weights):
        self.components = [
            MultivariateNormal(μ_k, Σ_k) for μ_k, Σ_k in zip(means, covariances)
        ]
        self.weights = weights

    def sample(self, n_samples):
        # Sample component index first
        component_idx = np.random.choice(100, p=self.weights)
        # Then sample from that component
        return self.components[component_idx].sample(n_samples)



MCMC still works - you just sample from the mixture instead of individual Gaussians.
2. Which Method to Start With?

My recommendation: Start with paper's approach (independent priors), then add complexity:
python



1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
# Phase 1: Baseline (paper's method)
β_oil ~ N(μ_oil, σ_oil²)        # Independent priors
β_exchange ~ N(μ_exchange, σ_exchange²)
β_competitor ~ N(μ_competitor, σ_competitor²)

# Phase 2: Add correlations
β ~ MultivariateNormal(μ_vector, Σ_matrix)

# Phase 3: Add interactions
model = β₁*oil + β₂*exchange + β₃*oil*exchange

# Phase 4: Time-varying (DLM)



Why start simple? Your boss cares about interpretability > accuracy. The basic approach is:

     Easiest to explain
     Most transparent
     Still captures most of the benefit
     Good baseline for comparison


3. DLM and BVAR Simplified

Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) intuition:
python



1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
# Static model (paper's approach):
stock_price = β₁*oil_price + β₂*exchange_rate + noise
# β₁ and β₂ are fixed over time

# Dynamic model:
stock_price_t = β₁ᵗ*oil_price_t + β₂ᵗ*exchange_rate_t + noise
# β₁ᵗ and β₂ᵗ change over time

# How they evolve:
β₁ᵗ = β₁ᵗ⁻¹ + random_walk_noise
β₂ᵗ = β₂ᵗ⁻¹ + random_walk_noise

# LLM elicits priors for:
# - Initial β₁⁰, β₂⁰ (same as paper)
# - How much they change over time (variance of random_walk_noise)



BVAR intuition:
python



1
2
3
4
5
6
# Includes lagged effects
stock_price_t = α + β₁*stock_price_{t-1} + β₂*oil_price_{t-1} + β₃*exchange_{t-1}

# LLM can elicit:
# - How persistent are stock price movements? (β₁ prior)
# - How long do oil price shocks take to affect stock? (β₂ prior)



For your project, I'd stick with static model first - DLM/BVAR add complexity without much interpretability gain.
4. Practical Variable Selection (My Recommendations)

Given your constraints (free data, simple team), here's what I'd use:

Target Variable: Monthly stock return (not price)
python



1
2
3
4
5
# Why returns, not prices?
return_t = (price_t - price_{t-1}) / price_{t-1}
# - Stationary (easier to model)
# - Interpretable (percentage change)
# - Standard in finance

predictor_variables = {

    "vix": "VIX (volatility index)",

    # Sector factors
    "chemical_index": "Chemical sector index return",
    "oil_price_change": "WTI oil price monthly change",

    # Macro factors
    "usd_krw_change": "USD/KRW exchange rate change",
    "interest_rate": "Korea 10-year bond yield",

    # Company factors
    "earnings_surprise": "Earnings vs consensus (from DART)",
    "revenue_growth": "YoY revenue growth (from DART)",

    # Relative performance
    "peer_performance": "Average return of chemical sector peers"
}



Frequency: Monthly (quarterly is too sparse, daily is too noisy)

5. Addressing Boss's "News Reaction" Requirement

This is actually perfect for your approach! Your boss wants interpretability > accuracy.

How to make model "react properly" to news:
python

        self.base_priors = self.elicit_base_priors()

    def update_priors_with_news(self, news_summary):
        # Ask LLM to adjust priors based on news
        prompt = f"""
        Given this news: {news_summary}
        How should we adjust our priors for 한화솔루션 stock prediction?

        Current priors:

        - Exchange rate effect: mean={self.base_priors['exchange']['mean']}

        Should any of these change? By how much?
        """

        adjusted_priors = self.llm.adjust_priors(prompt)
        return adjusted_priors

    def explain_reaction(self, news, prediction_change):
        # Generate explanation
        explanation = f"""
        News: {news}

        Model reaction:
        - Oil price sensitivity increased from 0.3 to 0.8
        - This is because the news suggests higher oil price volatility
        - Expected stock return changed from 2% to -1%

        This makes sense because 한화솔루션 is sensitive to input costs...
        """
        return explanation



This satisfies your boss because:

     Model reactions are explainable
     You can trace exactly why predictions changed
     LLM provides natural language explanations
     Focus on interpretability, not accuracy


Implementation Roadmap

Want me to help you write the basic implementation code?


Excellent question! Bayesian models actually offer much deeper interpretability than traditional ML models. Let me show you the multiple layers of explainability we can achieve:
Bayesian Models: Multi-Level Interpretability

Traditional XAI (LIME, SHAP) limitations:

     Post-hoc explanations
     Black-box model approximations
     No uncertainty quantification


Bayesian advantages:

     Built-in interpretability at every level
     Natural uncertainty quantification
     Interventional analysis capabilities

# After MCMC sampling, you get posterior distributions
β_oil_samples = posterior_samples['β_oil']  # 1000 samples

# Direct interpretation:
print(f"Oil price coefficient: {β_oil_samples.mean():.3f} ± {β_oil_samples.std():.3f}")
print(f"Interpretation: 1% increase in oil price → {β_oil_samples.mean():.1%} change in stock return")
print(f"Confidence: {(β_oil_samples > 0).mean():.1%} probability of positive effect")

# Visualize uncertainty
plt.hist(β_oil_samples, bins=50, alpha=0.7)
plt.axvline(0, color='red', linestyle='--', label='No effect')
plt.title('Oil Price Effect Distribution')

    intercept_samples = posterior_samples['intercept']
    beta_samples = posterior_samples['betas']  # shape: (n_samples, n_features)

    # Calculate contribution of each feature
    contributions = {}
    for i, feature_name in enumerate(feature_names):
        contributions[feature_name] = beta_samples[:, i] * x_new[i]

    # Total prediction
    total_prediction = intercept_samples + np.sum([contributions[f] for f in feature_names], axis=0)

    return contributions, total_prediction

# Example usage:

# Visualize

Want me to start coding the basic PoC with these interpretability features?

Excellent questions! You've identified two fundamental practical challenges that academic papers often gloss over. Let me give you my honest professional assessment:
1. Linearity Assumption Problem

You're absolutely right - linear regression is often inadequate for financial data. Here's the reality:

Financial relationships are typically:

     Non-linear: Stock returns vs oil prices might have threshold effects
     Regime-dependent: Relationships change during crises vs normal times
     Interactive: Oil price effects depend on exchange rates
     Time-varying: What worked in 2020 doesn't work in 2024

My recommendation: Start with Option A - it's interpretable, the paper's method works, and you can capture most nonlinearity through feature engineering.
2. Missing Future Predictor Data (THE REAL PROBLEM)

This is the elephant in the room that most academic papers ignore. You're absolutely correct - if someone asks "predict 2025 Q1 sales," you need 2025 Q1 predictor values, which don't exist yet.

Here are the realistic solutions:

My Honest Professional Assessment

For your MVP, I recommend:



    Feature Engineering + Linear Bayesian Model
         Capture nonlinearity through engineered features
         Keep interpretability that your boss wants
         LLM prior elicitation still works



    Scenario-Based Prediction
         Don't pretend to predict the future
         Give users tools to explore "what-if" scenarios
         More honest and actually useful



    Hybrid Approach
         Use lagged variables for baseline prediction
         Add scenario analysis for forward-looking insights
         Acknowledge uncertainty honestly

User: "Predict 한화솔루션 2025 Q1 sales"

System: "I can't predict future macro conditions, but I can help you explore scenarios:

Based on current trends (using lagged variables):
- Baseline prediction: 2.1 trillion KRW ± 0.3 trillion

Scenario analysis:
- If oil prices rise 10%: 1.9 trillion KRW ± 0.3 trillion
- If KRW weakens to 1400: 2.3 trillion KRW ± 0.3 trillion
- If both happen: 2.0 trillion KRW ± 0.4 trillion

Which scenario would you like to explore further?"

        # Use only lagged/known variables
        pass

    def hybrid_prediction(self):
        # Combine both approaches
        pass



Bottom line: The linearity problem is solvable with feature engineering. The missing future data problem is fundamental - address it with scenario analysis rather than pretending it doesn't exist.

This approach is more honest, more useful, and still showcases the LLM prior elicitation method effectively. Your boss will appreciate the transparency.

Want me to start coding this practical MVP approach?




Excellent points! You're absolutely right - if we're going to need multivariate anyway, implementing from scratch gives us full control and better understanding.
1. Implementation Strategy Decision

I vote for implementing from scratch for these reasons:

     Multivariate requirement: autoelicit only does univariate, we'll need multivariate
     Custom visualization: We need specific explainability features your boss wants
     Full control: Can customize everything for 한화솔루션 specifically
     Learning: Better to understand what's happening under the hood


Key files I'd like to see from the original codebase:
python

# Core implementation files I need to understand:
files_to_examine = [

    'llm_elicited_priors/utils.py',         # Prompt loading/processing
    'llm_prior_vs_no_prior.py',            # Main experiment script
    'prompts/elicitation/system_roles_*.txt', # Example prompts
    'prompts/elicitation/user_roles_*.txt',   # Example prompts
]



Could you show me these files so I understand:

     How they structure the LLM API calls
     How they convert LLM responses to prior distributions
     How they create the mixture of Gaussians
     Their prompt templates


2. Paraphrasing & Temperature

You're right about following the paper.

Temperature 0.1 clarification: Actually, low temperature (0.1) reduces variability - it makes outputs more deterministic/consistent. The paper uses 0.1 to get more reliable prior elicitation, not more variable paraphrasing.

The variability comes from:

     Different paraphrasing of the same prompt
     10 system roles × 10 user roles = 100 different prompt combinations
     Each combination might elicit slightly different priors from LLM

     I'll implement the core system from scratch
     Test with 한화솔루션 data
     Build visualization for your boss


Ready to start once I see those implementation files!

The from-scratch approach will give us exactly what we need for your boss's requirements, plus full understanding of the method.

Perfect! Now I understand the codebase structure. Let me answer your questions and outline my approach:
My Understanding of autoelicit

Yes, I can see exactly how it works now:



    Prompt Structure:
         10 system roles × 10 user roles = 100 combinations
         Each prompts LLM for JSON: {"feature_name": {"mean": X, "std": Y}}
         Temperature 0.1 for consistent responses



    Core Flow:
    python




    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    # For each of 100 prompt combinations:
    response = llm.get_result([system_role, user_role])
    # Parse JSON to get mean/std for each feature
    prior = [[bias_mean, bias_std], [feature1_mean, feature1_std], ...]
    # Final result: 100 priors, each is (n_features+1, 2) array




    Mixture Construction:
         100 individual Gaussian priors per feature
         Equal weights (1/100 each)
         p(θ) = Σ(k=1 to 100) (1/100) * N(μ_k, σ_k²)



Implementation Strategy

I'll implement from scratch for these reasons:

     Need multivariate extension anyway
     Want 한화솔루션-specific customizations
     Better understanding through implementation
     Can reuse their core logic patterns

Key Implementation Questions:



    Yahoo Finance Data Collection:
         Should I collect 2-3 years of monthly data?
         Any specific date range you prefer?



    Target Variable:
         Monthly returns: (price_t - price_{t-1}) / price_{t-1} ✓
         This is what I'll use



    Prompt Generation:
         Use their exact paraphrasing method with temperature 0.1 ✓
         Generate 10 system + 10 user variations = 100 combinations ✓



    Error Handling:
         I'll copy their robust JSON parsing logic
         Multiple fallback methods for parsing LLM responses



    Multivariate Extension:
         Phase 1: Univariate (replicating paper)
         Phase 2: Add correlation elicitation for multivariate
