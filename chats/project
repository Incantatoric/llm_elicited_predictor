Forget about right and wrong. I just wanted to remind you of what our goal is.
So my boss wants to use LLM to predict stock prices and revenues. That is why I ended up reading the paper and tried to apply it.
So what I ultimately want is this: it is an agent. An example conversation would look like this:

user: I want you to predict Hanwha Solution stock price next month.
agent: I think these variables should be used. What do you think?
user: Let us add X as well and remove Y.
agent: Sure. I will use 3 years worth of data. Would this be OK?
user: Yup.
agent: Now I will start asking you about your prior information on the variables and their impact on the target variable stock price. What do you think about oil price affecting the stock price?
user: blah blah blah
repeat this process for all the variables.
agent: Thank you. I will now use your prior information to predict.
fitting...
agent: Thank you for your waiting. I think predicted stock is this.
Each variable has probability of such and such. And the final stock return has following confidence interval and blah blah blah (explainability to executives.)

Here, the key point is that
- We still use LLM.
- LLM is bad at numerical reasoning, so we use modelling, but it is Bayesian and can incorporate user's prior information easily.
- Bayesian linear regresison is such a basic model; we can later try to use complex models but for now we don't need a complex model. The point is in utilizing LLM to predic things. Accuracy is a second problem for now. Even this, we could introduce innate feature engineering, using multivarite normal so that we could use correlation information from the user. You can also think of other methods to overcome its limitation.
- Explainability is extremely important since the agent will be used by executives. In fact, another LLM has given me the following answers:
Excellent question! Bayesian models actually offer much deeper interpretability than traditional ML models. Let me show you the multiple layers of explainability we can achieve:
Bayesian Models: Multi-Level Interpretability

Traditional XAI (LIME, SHAP) limitations:

     Post-hoc explanations
     Black-box model approximations
     No uncertainty quantification


Bayesian advantages:

     Built-in interpretability at every level
     Natural uncertainty quantification
     Interventional analysis capabilities


1. Parameter-Level Interpretability

Each coefficient tells a story:
python


# After MCMC sampling, you get posterior distributions
β_oil_samples = posterior_samples['β_oil']  # 1000 samples

# Direct interpretation:
print(f"Oil price coefficient: {β_oil_samples.mean():.3f} ± {β_oil_samples.std():.3f}")
print(f"Interpretation: 1% increase in oil price → {β_oil_samples.mean():.1%} change in stock return")
print(f"Confidence: {(β_oil_samples > 0).mean():.1%} probability of positive effect")

# Visualize uncertainty
plt.hist(β_oil_samples, bins=50, alpha=0.7)
plt.axvline(0, color='red', linestyle='--', label='No effect')
plt.title('Oil Price Effect Distribution')


2. Prediction Decomposition

Break down each prediction:
python

def decompose_prediction(x_new, posterior_samples):
    """
    Show exactly how each variable contributes to the prediction
    """
    # Get posterior samples for all parameters
    intercept_samples = posterior_samples['intercept']
    beta_samples = posterior_samples['betas']  # shape: (n_samples, n_features)

    # Calculate contribution of each feature
    contributions = {}
    for i, feature_name in enumerate(feature_names):
        contributions[feature_name] = beta_samples[:, i] * x_new[i]

    # Total prediction
    total_prediction = intercept_samples + np.sum([contributions[f] for f in feature_names], axis=0)

    return contributions, total_prediction

# Example usage:
contributions, prediction = decompose_prediction(current_market_data, posterior_samples)

# Visualize
feature_effects = {name: contrib.mean() for name, contrib in contributions.items()}
plt.barh(list(feature_effects.keys()), list(feature_effects.values()))
plt.title('Feature Contributions to Prediction')


3. Interventional Analysis (Like Concept Bottleneck Models)

This is where Bayesian models really shine:
python

class BayesianInterventionalAnalysis:
    def __init__(self, model, posterior_samples):
        self.model = model
        self.posterior = posterior_samples

    def intervene_on_feature(self, feature_name, intervention_value):
        """
        What happens if we force a feature to have a specific value?
        """
        # Create counterfactual scenario
        original_data = self.current_data.copy()
        intervened_data = original_data.copy()
        intervened_data[feature_name] = intervention_value

        # Predict under both scenarios
        original_pred = self.predict(original_data)
        intervened_pred = self.predict(intervened_data)

        effect = intervened_pred - original_pred

        return {
            'original_prediction': original_pred,
            'intervened_prediction': intervened_pred,
            'causal_effect': effect,
            'explanation': f"Forcing {feature_name} = {intervention_value} changes prediction by {effect.mean():.3f}"
        }

    def sensitivity_analysis(self, feature_name, value_range):
        """
        How sensitive is the prediction to changes in this feature?
        """
        effects = []
        for value in value_range:
            effect = self.intervene_on_feature(feature_name, value)
            effects.append(effect['causal_effect'].mean())

        return value_range, effects

    def counterfactual_analysis(self, target_prediction):
        """
        What would need to change to achieve target_prediction?
        """
        # Find minimal changes needed
        # This is like "what-if" analysis
        pass

# Usage example:
analyzer = BayesianInterventionalAnalysis(model, posterior_samples)

# "What if oil prices suddenly spike 20%?"
oil_shock = analyzer.intervene_on_feature('oil_price_change', 0.20)
print(oil_shock['explanation'])

# "How sensitive are we to exchange rate changes?"
fx_range = np.linspace(-0.1, 0.1, 21)
fx_sensitivity = analyzer.sensitivity_analysis('usd_krw_change', fx_range)
plt.plot(fx_range, fx_sensitivity)
plt.title('Sensitivity to Exchange Rate Changes')


4. Prior vs. Data Influence Analysis

Show how much comes from LLM priors vs. observed data:
python

def prior_vs_data_influence(prior_samples, posterior_samples):
    """
    Compare prior beliefs with posterior (after seeing data)
    """
    influence_analysis = {}

    for param_name in prior_samples.keys():
        prior_mean = prior_samples[param_name].mean()
        posterior_mean = posterior_samples[param_name].mean()

        # How much did the data change our beliefs?
        belief_shift = posterior_mean - prior_mean

        # How much uncertainty did we reduce?
        prior_uncertainty = prior_samples[param_name].std()
        posterior_uncertainty = posterior_samples[param_name].std()
        uncertainty_reduction = (prior_uncertainty - posterior_uncertainty) / prior_uncertainty

        influence_analysis[param_name] = {
            'prior_belief': prior_mean,
            'posterior_belief': posterior_mean,
            'belief_shift': belief_shift,
            'uncertainty_reduction': uncertainty_reduction,
            'data_influence': 'High' if abs(belief_shift) > 0.1 else 'Low'
        }

    return influence_analysis

# Visualization
def plot_prior_posterior_comparison(prior_samples, posterior_samples):
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(15, 10))
    axes = axes.flatten()

    for i, param_name in enumerate(prior_samples.keys()):
        ax = axes[i]

        # Plot prior and posterior distributions
        ax.hist(prior_samples[param_name], alpha=0.5, label='Prior (LLM belief)', bins=30)
        ax.hist(posterior_samples[param_name], alpha=0.5, label='Posterior (After data)', bins=30)

        ax.set_title(f'{param_name}: Prior vs Posterior')
        ax.legend()
        ax.axvline(0, color='red', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()


5. Practical Implementation for 한화솔루션
python


class InterpretableHanwhaBayesianModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None
        self.posterior_samples = None
        self.feature_names = [
            'kospi_return', 'oil_price_change', 'usd_krw_change',
            'chemical_sector_return', 'vix_change'
        ]

    def explain_prediction(self, x_new):
        """

        """

        # 3. Create visualizations
        self.visualize_explanation(contributions, prediction)

        return explanation

    def generate_explanation(self, contributions, prediction):
        """

        """
        # Format contributions for LLM
        contrib_text = ""
        for feature, contrib in contributions.items():
            contrib_text += f"- {feature}: {contrib.mean():.3f} (±{contrib.std():.3f})\n"

        prompt = f"""

        """

        explanation = self.llm.generate_explanation(prompt)
        return explanation

    def interactive_what_if(self):
        """
        Interactive tool for scenario analysis
        """
        print("What-if Analysis Tool for 한화솔루션")
        print("Current prediction:", self.current_prediction)

        while True:
            variable = input("Which variable to change? (or 'quit'): ")
            if variable == 'quit':
                break

            if variable in self.feature_names:
                new_value = float(input(f"New value for {variable}: "))
                result = self.intervene_on_feature(variable, new_value)
                print(f"New prediction: {result['intervened_prediction'].mean():.3f}")
                print(f"Change: {result['causal_effect'].mean():.3f}")
            else:
                print("Invalid variable name")

Among these, I think the agent should be capabale of printing out the following plots:
- prior mean and std stacks (the one you have created, I think I will rather use this for the debugging purposes, probably not going to show it to the user)
- prior mixture distribution
- posterior mixture distribution

If possible, it should store the posterior somewhere temporarily and then it should be reusable for quick inference and doing other stuff with it as user requests.

However, this method has fundamental design flaws. In order to predict future, we need future predictor variables. And obviously we do not know future predictor variables like oil prices and so on. There are many methods to overcome this, and one method previous LLM has suggested is to use scenarios instead. This will help the executives have an idea and hunch how the stock price will move based on his idea. I think this process should be included in the agent conversation process (maybe we could use LangGraph or Google SDK or whatever to handle this). The reason I did not include it yet is because I wanted to listen to your opinion. You might find other breakthroughs here.

And the reason why I told you your code is still not wasted is because I need to show my boss that this method is not some cheap shit but it actually works. And your code exactly does that. But this is definitely not our main goal since our main goal is an agent. But also I think we could probably use your plots to somewhere else in the main agent process. For now, I think this whole testing procedure should be stored in other places other than the main agent codes for reporting or testing purposes. I will leave it to you how you should handle this.

Here is the result of running your code:

Do not code anything yet. Could you give me your serious, professional, critical thoughts on this? Do not try to cut around the corners. There are many things that you should digest. Take your time and answer. And in order to understand the previous workflow, I recommend you to check the @backup_generated_files to see how it was going to work based on the previous LLM's work.
