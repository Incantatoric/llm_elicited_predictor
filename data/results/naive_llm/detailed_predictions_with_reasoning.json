The significant decrease in oil prices by -2.4692 may have a positive impact on the company's profitability and overall market sentiment. 3. USD_KRW_Change: The change in USD/KRW exchange rate has also influenced \ud55c\ud654\uc194\ub8e8\uc158 stock return in the past. The decrease in USD/KRW by -0.8448 could potentially benefit the company's export competitiveness. 4. VIX_Change: The VIX index, a measure of market volatility, has shown a negative correlation with \ud55c\ud654\uc194\ub8e8\uc158 stock return. The decrease in VIX by 0.5462 indicates lower market volatility, which is generally positive for stock returns. 5. Materials_Sector_Return: The performance of the materials sector has impacted \ud55c\ud654\uc194\ub8e8\uc158 stock return. The negative return of -0.5737 in the sector may pose a slight challenge for the company's stock return. Considering these factors and the overall positive market conditions, I predict a modest stock return of 0.0234 for \ud55c\ud654\uc194\ub8e8\uc158 on 2025-04-30."
