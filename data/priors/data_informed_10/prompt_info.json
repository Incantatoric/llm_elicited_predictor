The standardized features included in my dataset are: [\"kospi_return\", \"oil_price_change\", \"usd_krw_change\", \"vix_change\", \"materials_sector_return\"]. Investigate how each feature affects Hanwha Solutions stock returns and provide your regression coefficient priors.\nREQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (use the EXACT format with EXACT feature names):\n{\n  \"kospi_return\": {\"mean\": 0.0, \"std\": 1.0, \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\"},\n  \"oil_price_change\": {\"mean\": 0.0, \"std\": 1.0, \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\"},\n  \"usd_krw_change\": {\"mean\": 0.0, \"std\": 1.0, \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\"},\n  \"vix_change\": {\"mean\": 0.0, \"std\": 1.0, \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\"},\n  \"materials_sector_return\": {\"mean\": 0.0, \"std\": 1.0, \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\"}\n}\nDo NOT create the first-level key for this JSON object. For example, JSON format below is WRONG:\n  \"regression_coefficient_priors\": {\n    \"kospi_return\": {\"mean\": 0.0, \"std\": 1.0, \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\"},\n    \"oil_price_change\": {\"mean\": 0.0, \"std\": 1.0, \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\"},\n    \"usd_krw_change\": {\"mean\": 0.0, \"std\": 1.0, \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\"},\n    \"vix_change\": {\"mean\": 0.0, \"std\": 1.0, \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\"},\n    \"materials_sector_return\": {\"mean\": 0.0, \"std\": 1.0, \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\"}\n  }\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Use EXACT feature names above\n- mean: expected regression coefficient (how this variable affects stock returns)\n- std: your confidence level (smaller = more confident)\n- We need REGRESSION COEFFICIENT PRIORS, not data generation\n- Respond ONLY with the JSON object"
