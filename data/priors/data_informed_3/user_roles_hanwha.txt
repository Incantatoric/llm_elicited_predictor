HISTORICAL DATA FOR REGRESSION COEFFICIENT PRIOR ASSESSMENT:
The following data shows 30 months of historical relationships between
economic variables and Hanwha Solutions stock returns.
You are going to use this data to generate mean and std for each regression coefficient priors in a very specific JSON format(mean = expected correlation strength, std = confidence level).
Later these normal distributions with different means and std will be added to create the prior distribution for the coefficients
VARIABLE EXPLANATIONS:
• kospi_return: Monthly % change in Korean KOSPI stock index
• oil_price_change: Monthly % change in crude oil prices
• usd_krw_change: Monthly % change in USD/KRW exchange rate
• vix_change: Monthly % change in VIX volatility index
• materials_sector_return: Monthly % change in materials sector index
• hanwha_stock: Monthly % return of Hanwha Solutions stock
All variables are standardized (z-score) with mean=0, std=1 for historical period.
Data represents end-of-month values from July 2022 to January 2025.

Based on these historical patterns and your own knowledge, provide mean and std for each coefficient prior into the exact JSON format below.
We need COEFFICIENT PRIORS for linear regression, not data generation.
Based on the historical patterns shown above, I need your expert assessment of regression coefficient priors for predicting Hanwha Solutions monthly stock returns. My dataset has these standardized features: ["kospi_return", "oil_price_change", "usd_krw_change", "vix_change", "materials_sector_return"]. For each feature, analyze how it affects Hanwha Solutions stock returns and provide your regression coefficient priors.
REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (use the EXACT format with EXACT feature names):
{
  "kospi_return": {"mean": 0.0, "std": 1.0, "reasoning": "Brief explanation"},
  "oil_price_change": {"mean": 0.0, "std": 1.0, "reasoning": "Brief explanation"},
  "usd_krw_change": {"mean": 0.0, "std": 1.0, "reasoning": "Brief explanation"},
  "vix_change": {"mean": 0.0, "std": 1.0, "reasoning": "Brief explanation"},
  "materials_sector_return": {"mean": 0.0, "std": 1.0, "reasoning": "Brief explanation"}
}
Do NOT create the first-level key for this JSON object. For example, JSON format below is WRONG:
  "regression_coefficient_priors": {
    "kospi_return": {"mean": 0.0, "std": 1.0, "reasoning": "Brief explanation"},
    "oil_price_change": {"mean": 0.0, "std": 1.0, "reasoning": "Brief explanation"},
    "usd_krw_change": {"mean": 0.0, "std": 1.0, "reasoning": "Brief explanation"},
    "vix_change": {"mean": 0.0, "std": 1.0, "reasoning": "Brief explanation"},
    "materials_sector_return": {"mean": 0.0, "std": 1.0, "reasoning": "Brief explanation"}
  }
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use EXACT feature names above
- mean: expected regression coefficient (how this variable affects stock returns)
- std: your confidence level (smaller = more confident)
- We need REGRESSION COEFFICIENT PRIORS, not data generation
- Respond ONLY with the JSON object
